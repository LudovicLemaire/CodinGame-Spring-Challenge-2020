## Rules

To win you have to get more Pellets than your opponent.
If you don't give an order within 50ms, you loose.
If you don't have Pacman anymore, you loose.
If you give two orders to the same Pacman, you loose.

There can be a random amount of Pacmans.
Map is always symmetrical.
There is magic portal from left to right.

Your pacmans have random form between Paper/Scissors/Rock. If two opponent Pacman run into each other, and are different form, the looser die. If there are both same form, they block each other.

There is big pellet, than can be seen from anywhere on the map. Small pellets can only be seen acording to your vision (you can't see through wall).

There is 2 spells :
- Speed : your pacman will do 2 turn instead of 1 during 5 turns.
- Switch : your pacman change form to whatever you want.
A spell has a cooldown of 10 turns (that affect both).
